               The "Accept" header field can be used by user agents to specify
               response media types that are acceptable.  Accept header fields can be used to indicate that the request is specifically limited to a small set of desired types, as in the case of a request for an
               in-line image.</td>

               for "no encoding" in order to communicate when no encoding is
               preferred.

               comprehensive or special-purpose charsets to signal that capability to an origin server that is capable of representing information in those charsets.

               The "Authorization" header field allows a user agent to authenticate itself with an origin server -- usually, but not necessarily, after receiving a 401 (Unauthorized) response. Its value consists of credentials containing the authentication information of the user
               agent for the realm of the resource being requested.

               The "Host" header field in a request provides the host and port
               information from the target URI, enabling the origin server to
               distinguish among resources while servicing requests for multiple host names on a single IP address.

               The "If-None-Match" header field makes the request method conditional on a recipient cache or origin server either not having any current
               representation of the target resource, when the field-value is "*",
               or having a selected representation with an entity-tag that does not match any of those listed in the field-value.
