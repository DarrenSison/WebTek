			handling the request.  An entity-tag is an opaque validator for
			differentiating between multiple representations of the same
			resource, regardless of whether those multiple representations are
			due to resource state changes over time, content negotiation
			resulting in multiple representations being valid at the same time,
			or both.  An entity-tag consists of an opaque quoted string, possibly
			prefixed by a weakness indicator.

               The "Location" header field is used in some responses to refer to a

               The "Server" header field contains information about the software

				problems, to work around or tailor requests to avoid particular
				server limitations, and for analytics regarding server or operating

				request target, might influence the origin server's process for
				selecting and representing this response.  The value consists of
				either a single asterisk ("*") or a list of header field names
				(case-insensitive).
